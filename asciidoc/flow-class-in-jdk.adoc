/**
 * Interrelated interfaces and static methods for establishing
 * flow-controlled components in which {@link Publisher Publishers}
 * produce items consumed by one or more {@link Subscriber
 * Subscribers}, each managed by a {@link Subscription
 * Subscription}.
 *
 * 用于建立流控制组件的接口和静态方法，其中 {@link Publisher Publisher}
 * 发布由一个或多个 {@link Subscriber Subscribers} 消费的项目，
 * 每一个 {@link Subscriber Subscribers} 都由一个 {@link Subscription Subscription} 管理。
 *
 * <p>These interfaces correspond to the <a
 * href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/"> reactive-streams</a>
 * specification.  They apply in both concurrent and distributed
 * asynchronous settings: All (seven) methods are defined in {@code
 * void} "one-way" message style. Communication relies on a simple form
 * of flow control (method {@link Subscription#request}) that can be
 * used to avoid resource management problems that may otherwise occur
 * in "push" based systems.
 *
 * <p>这些接口对应<a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/"> reactive-streams</a>
 * 规范。其适用于并发和分布式异步环境：所有（7个）方法均定义为无返回值的“单向”消息风格。
 * 通信依赖于一种简式流量控制（方法{@link Subscription#request}）
 * 这可以用来避免在基于“推”的系统中可能出现的资源管理问题。
 *
 * <p><b>Examples.</b> A {@link Publisher} usually defines its own
 * {@link Subscription} implementation; constructing one in method
 * {@code subscribe} and issuing it to the calling {@link
 * Subscriber}. It publishes items to the subscriber asynchronously,
 * normally using an {@link Executor}.  For example, here is a very
 * simple publisher that only issues (when requested) a single {@code
 * TRUE} item to a single subscriber.  Because the subscriber receives
 * only a single item, this class does not use buffering and ordering
 * control required in most implementations (for example {@link
 * SubmissionPublisher}).
 *
 * <p><b>例如。</b> 一个 {@link Publisher} 通常定义自己的 {@link Subscription} 实现; 
 * 在{@code subscribe}方法中构造{@link Subscription}并将其发送给{@link Subscriber}。
 * 其通常使用{@link Executor}异步的向订阅者发布项目。 
 * 例如，下面是一个非常简单二发布者，它只向单个订阅者发布（当订阅者请求时）一个{@code TRUE}元素。
 * 因为订阅者只接受一个项目，这个类不使用大多数实现中所需要的缓冲和排序控制（例如{@link SubmissionPublisher}）
 * <pre> {@code
 *
 * class OneShotPublisher implements Publisher<Boolean> {
 *   private final ExecutorService executor = ForkJoinPool.commonPool(); // daemon-based
 *   private boolean subscribed; // true after first subscribe
 *   public synchronized void subscribe(Subscriber<? super Boolean> subscriber) {
 *     if (subscribed)
 *       subscriber.onError(new IllegalStateException()); // only one allowed
 *     else {
 *       subscribed = true;
 *       subscriber.onSubscribe(new OneShotSubscription(subscriber, executor));
 *     }
 *   }
 *   static class OneShotSubscription implements Subscription {
 *     private final Subscriber<? super Boolean> subscriber;
 *     private final ExecutorService executor;
 *     private Future<?> future; // to allow cancellation
 *     private boolean completed;
 *     OneShotSubscription(Subscriber<? super Boolean> subscriber,
 *                         ExecutorService executor) {
 *       this.subscriber = subscriber;
 *       this.executor = executor;
 *     }
 *     public synchronized void request(long n) {
 *       if (!completed) {
 *         completed = true;
 *         if (n <= 0) {
 *           IllegalArgumentException ex = new IllegalArgumentException();
 *           executor.execute(() -> subscriber.onError(ex));
 *         } else {
 *           future = executor.submit(() -> {
 *             subscriber.onNext(Boolean.TRUE);
 *             subscriber.onComplete();
 *           });
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *     public synchronized void cancel() {
 *       completed = true;
 *       if (future != null) future.cancel(false);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>A {@link Subscriber} arranges that items be requested and
 * processed.  Items (invocations of {@link Subscriber#onNext}) are
 * not issued unless requested, but multiple items may be requested.
 * Many Subscriber implementations can arrange this in the style of
 * the following example, where a buffer size of 1 single-steps, and
 * larger sizes usually allow for more efficient overlapped processing
 * with less communication; for example with a value of 64, this keeps
 * total outstanding requests between 32 and 64.
 * Because Subscriber method invocations for a given {@link
 * Subscription} are strictly ordered, there is no need for these
 * methods to use locks or volatiles unless a Subscriber maintains
 * multiple Subscriptions (in which case it is better to instead
 * define multiple Subscribers, each with its own Subscription).
 *
 * <p>{@link Subscriber}会负责对元素的请求和处理
 * 除非订阅者请求元素元素否则不会发出项目（调用{@link Subscriber#onNext}）
 * ,但可以一次请求多个元素。许多订阅者实现会按照以下示例的风格进行协商，
 * 其中缓冲区大小为1个single-step,并且更大的大小通常允许更有效的overlapped处理，
 * 和更少的通信, 比如，值为64,这会将未完成的请求总数保持在 32 到 64 之间。
 * 因为给定 Flow.Subscription 的订阅者方法调用是严格排序的，
 * 除非订阅者维护多个订阅，否则这些方法不需要使用锁或易失性 
 * （在这种情况下，最好定义多个订阅者，每个订阅者都有自己的订阅）。
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class SampleSubscriber<T> implements Subscriber<T> {
 *   final Consumer<? super T> consumer;
 *   Subscription subscription;
 *   final long bufferSize;
 *   long count;
 *   SampleSubscriber(long bufferSize, Consumer<? super T> consumer) {
 *     this.bufferSize = bufferSize;
 *     this.consumer = consumer;
 *   }
 *   public void onSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
 *     long initialRequestSize = bufferSize;
 *     count = bufferSize - bufferSize / 2; // re-request when half consumed
 *     (this.subscription = subscription).request(initialRequestSize);
 *   }
 *   public void onNext(T item) {
 *     if (--count <= 0)
 *       subscription.request(count = bufferSize - bufferSize / 2);
 *     consumer.accept(item);
 *   }
 *   public void onError(Throwable ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); }
 *   public void onComplete() {}
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The default value of {@link #defaultBufferSize} may provide a
 * useful starting point for choosing request sizes and capacities in
 * Flow components based on expected rates, resources, and usages.
 * Or, when flow control is never needed, a subscriber may initially
 * request an effectively unbounded number of items, as in:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class UnboundedSubscriber<T> implements Subscriber<T> {
 *   public void onSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
 *     subscription.request(Long.MAX_VALUE); // effectively unbounded
 *   }
 *   public void onNext(T item) { use(item); }
 *   public void onError(Throwable ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); }
 *   public void onComplete() {}
 *   void use(T item) { ... }
 * }}</pre>
