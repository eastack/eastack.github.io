= 范型

----
In any nontrivial software project, bugs are simply a fact of life.
Careful planning, programming, and testing can help reduce their pervasiveness, but somehow, somewhere, they'll always find a way to creep into your code.
This becomes especially apparent as new features are introduced and your code base grows in size and complexity.

在常见的软件项目中，错误难以避免。
细心规划、编程和测试可以帮助我们减少 BUG 的存在，但无论如何，他们总有办法潜入你的代码中。
特别是伴随着新功能的引入以及代码库大小和复杂性的增长，这一点变得越发明显。

----
Fortunately, some bugs are easier to detect than others.
Compile-time bugs, for example, can be detected early on; you can use the compiler's error messages to figure out what the problem is and fix it, right then and there.
Runtime bugs, however, can be much more problematic; they don't always surface immediately, and when they do, it may be at a point in the program that is far removed from the actual cause of the problem.

幸运的是，有些错误还是比较容易检测。
比如编译器可以在早期发现编译错误;你可以通过编译器报错信息找出问题所在并立即修复它。
但运行时错误回来更多问题;他们并不是立即显现出来，当他们出现时，可能已经与程序中问题实际原因想去甚远。

Generics add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile time.
After completing this lesson, you may want to follow up with the Generics tutorial by Gilad Bracha.
