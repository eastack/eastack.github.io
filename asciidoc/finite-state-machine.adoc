= 有限状态机

----
A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation.
It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.[1]
An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.
Finite-state machines are of two types—deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines.[2] 
A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.

一个有限状态机（FSM：finite-state machine）或有限状态自动机（FSA：finite-state automaton，复数：automata）,有限自动机，或简称状态机，是一个数学计算模型。
他是一种抽象的机器，其在任意给定时间精确的处在有限状态之一。
FSM 可以响应输入而从一种状态转变为另一种状态; 从一种状态到另一种状态的转变称为转换。
FSM 由其状态列表，初始状态及触发每个转换的输入定义。
有限状态机有两种类型——确定有限状态机和非确定有限状态机。
确定性有限状态机可以构造为与任何非确定性机器等价。

The behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented.
Simple examples are vending machines, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited, elevators, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders, traffic lights, which change sequence when cars are waiting, and combination locks, which require the input of a sequence of numbers in the proper order.

状态机的行为可以在现代生活的许多设备中见到，它们根据其定义的一系列事件，执行一系列预订义的动作。
